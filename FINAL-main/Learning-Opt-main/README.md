## üìå About

**Creotec Certificate Generator** is a web-based application designed to streamline the creation of official certificates for OJT, work immersion, internship, and other academic or organizational events.

Built with **React**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Flask**, this system allows admins to upload recipient data (CSV/Excel), choose certificate templates, customize contents, preview, and print certificates ‚Äî all in one page.

# Setup & Run Instructions

## 1. Install dependencies (frontend & backend)

Run this command in the **frontend** directory:

```bash
npm run install-all
```

This will:

- Install all frontend dependencies

- Create and activate a Python virtual environment in the backend folder

- Install backend Python dependencies from requirements.txt

**Note:** The activation command in the script is for Windows (`venv\Scripts\activate`).  
For macOS/Linux, you might need to modify it to `source venv/bin/activate`.

## 2. Start frontend and backend servers concurrently

Run this command in the **frontend** directory:

```bash
npm run start-all
```

This will start both frontend (Vite) and backend (Flask) servers concurrently.

## Notes

- The backend requires Python 3.8+ and the dependencies listed in `backend/requirements.txt`.

- Make sure you run the `npm run install-all` **inside the frontend directory** to properly set up both frontend and backend.

- The Flask backend runs on port 5000 by default; the frontend (Vite) runs on port 5173.

- For production deployment, consider using a production-ready WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn) instead of Flask‚Äôs development server.

- If you encounter permission issues with the virtual environment activation, try running your terminal as Administrator or adjust execution policies (especially on Windows PowerShell).

- To stop both servers started by `npm run start-all`, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

## üß† OOP Principles Applied

<ul>
  <li><strong>Encapsulation</strong> ‚Äì Backend services encapsulate logic for certificate generation and PDF rendering via Flask.</li>
  <li><strong>Abstraction</strong> ‚Äì Common utility functions and hooks abstract repetitive UI behaviors and API calls.</li>
  <li><strong>Inheritance</strong> ‚Äì Certificate templates inherit a base layout style and override properties for customization.</li>
  <li><strong>Polymorphism</strong> ‚Äì Template rendering functions support dynamic content substitution based on user input.</li>
</ul>
